Hello! 

My name is Rishabh. I am an electrical engineer by training and a self taught software developer with interests in embedded software/middleware design, Linux and learning new things about these two. I look for cool applications in the domains of consumers electronics (especially wearables), medical devices and robotics and try to learn about them through emulation from grounds up.

Why am I blogging? To that I say, do we need to have a reason? It is a form of self expression for me, it helps to organize my thoughts about - what I have learnt, what I have accomplished and so on. If nobody else reads this, atleast I can come back to it and review my past actions, so I can do better in the future. 


Should you waste time reading this blog? Well, I invite you to read and leave your comments, it will certainly help me. But you might also find some useful peices - howtos, design documents of my software projects, conceptual overviews of CS theory or non-fiction books, life hacks which mayyyyy be helpful. I do want to assure you that I will keep it short and sweet.  

Looking forward to seeing you around!

Rishabh
